# Course Project

### Overview

The bulk of the course grade will be a group project that will be due at the end of the semester. Students will be required to present their progress throughout the course of the semester. Grades will be assigned on the basis of overall project quality, demonstration of core principles taught in the class, and individual contributions to the group's effort.

### Proposal

The goal of your project proposal is to demonstrate that your project is feasible. The proposal should include:

* **Motivation**
  *  ****Describe the problem you are trying to solve and/or the question you are trying to answer. 
* **Data**:
  * Describe the data that you are going to use. Where did this data come from? How are you going to access it? Why did you choose this dataset? Also include a data dictionary for the raw data.
