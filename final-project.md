# Course Project

### Overview

The bulk of the course grade will be a group project that will be due at the end of the semester. Students will be required to present their progress throughout the course of the semester. Grades will be assigned on the basis of overall project quality, demonstration of core principles taught in the class, and individual contributions to the group's effort.&#x20;

### Proposal

The goal of your project proposal is to demonstrate that your project is feasible. The proposal should include:

* **Motivation**
  * &#x20;**** Describe the problem you are trying to solve and/or the question you are trying to answer.&#x20;
* **Data**:
  * Describe the data that you are going to use. Where did this data come from? How are you going to access it? Why did you choose this dataset? Also include a data dictionary for the raw data.
  * Describe what cleaning and/or processing you may have to do with your data before you can begin analysis.
* **Analysis Plan**
  * Describe at least one approach you will try to answer your question.&#x20;
* **Challenges:**
  * Describe any challenges you anticipate while working on the project.
* **Ethical Considerations**
  * Who is being centered? Who is being marginalized?
  * What harm might this project cause?

Your project proposal should be 1-2 pages single-spaced. You can use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FCQERhKoaBh2wt0MI3Vhk-M7m6DOSTdHj67yPv8xcfo/edit?usp=sharing) to format your proposal or create your own.&#x20;

Feel free to include any other information that you think would be helpful for me to understand your project!

### Preliminary Analysis

&#x20;Your preliminary analysis should include:

* **Data Cleaning Code**
  * Code for cleaning and processing your data. Include a data dictionary for your transformed dataset.
* **Exploratory Analysis**
  * Describe what work you have done so far and include the code. This may include descriptive statistics, graphs and charts, and preliminary models.
* &#x20;**Challenges**
  * Describe any challenges you've encountered so far. **Let me know if there's anything you need help with!**
* **Future Work**
  * Describe what work you are planning to complete for the final analysis.
* **Contributions**
  * Describe the contributions that each group member made.

Your preliminary analysis does not have to be a formal writeup. You will submit your Github repository for your project.

### Blog Post & Presentation&#x20;

Your blog post and presentation should include:

* **Motivation**
  * What is the problem you were trying to solve? Why is this an interesting problem? Assume that your audience knows nothing! Convince them that this is a problem worth solving.&#x20;
* **Data**
  * Describe your data. What are its limitations?
* **Evaluation**
  * Evaluate your model. Do you feel confident about its performance?
* **Future Work**
  * Describe what work you would do in the future. This can include work to improve your model, building related models, and/or sourcing different datasets. Are there any other interesting questions you uncovered while you were working on your model?
