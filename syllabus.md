# Syllabus

## Course Description

This course consists of a survey of analytical tools and concepts in data science, with goal of equipping students with an understanding of the best practices used by professional data scientists and analysts in top companies in technology, finance, and media.&#x20;

The course begins with an overview of fundamentals in data handling and exploratory data analysis, followed by an introduction to core concepts in statistical modeling and machine learning, and concludes with a brief introduction advanced concepts in data science.

Students will work with a wide variety of real-world data sets throughout the course in order to gain hands on experience. Emphasis will be placed on frequent practice through writing and reviewing code each week.&#x20;

In addition, students will be assigned and expected to discuss short reading assignments ranging from academic reviews of popular topics in analytics as well as data science and engineering blog posts from companies such as Airbnb, Spotify, and Facebook.

Tasks and readings will aim to demystify the work of data teams in the real world, and familiarize students with the concepts and resources needed to secure and succeed in analytical roles.&#x20;

Enrollment Prerequisites: CSC 22000 & CSC 22100.

## Course Goals

Through this course, students should be able to:

1. Explain the key steps in a data science project.
2. Apply Python to load, clean, and process data sets.
3. Identify key elements of and patterns in a data set using computational analysis and statistical methods.&#x20;
4. Explain and visualize empirical findings using with Python and other resources.
5. Explain fundamental principles of machine learning.
6. Apply predictive algorithms to a data set.
7. Work effectively in a team dedicated to analyzing data.&#x20;

****[**Weekly Assignments**](weekly-assignments.md)****\
****This class includes ten weekly assignments to check comprehension and practice skills. All assignments must be completed by Week 14. You are highly encouraged to keep up with the assignments week to week.

****[**Data Science Presentation**](presentations.md)****\
****This class includes a 5-10 minute presentation on an articles or talk that connects a data science method to a problem. The goal of this assignment is to learn more about how data science and data analytics is applied in industry.

**Midterm Exam** \
A short midterm exam will be held in October and will focus on broad concepts the course has surveyed thus far. The format will mimic the style of questions frequently asked in interviews for data-related roles.&#x20;

****[**Project**](final-project.md)\
The bulk of the course grade will be a group project that will be due at the end of the semester. Students will be expected to work on the project during the second half of the class and will be required to present their progress throughout the course of the semester. Grades will be assigned on the basis of overall project quality, demonstration of core principles taught in the class, and individual contributions to the group's effort.&#x20;

### **Late Work**

**I expect you to inform me to the best of your ability and as soon as possible if you cannot complete an assignment and/or an assignment with be late.** I will make every effort to ensure that you are able to receive full or partial credit for the assignment. In the event that an assignment is missing and there has not been any communication before the deadline, I reserve the right to assign you a zero.

### **Participation**

Students are expected to attend class, be active participants in discussion, and be engaged with the course material. This includes, but is not limited to, discussing assigned readings and videos and sharing ideas during classroom exercises.

Participation is not graded and there is no limit to absences. **I expect you inform me to the best of your ability and as soon as possible if you cannot attend class.** If you are excessively absence without a reasonable explanation, I reserve the right to drop you from the course.
