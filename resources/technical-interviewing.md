# Technical Interviewing

### How to Prepare

* **Start practicing early!** As you as you know that you're going to be applying for software engineering jobs, start practicing. It's a pain, but you'll be so much less stressed.
* **Aim to do one problem a day!** [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) will send you one.
* **Focus on "Medium" problems.** Use HackerRank and Leetcode as a benchmarks.
* **Push yourself to practice topics that you hate.**
* **Practice a full interview with someone else.** Communication and "thinking out loud" are how you demonstrate your problem-solving skills to an interview.&#x20;
* **Make a cheat sheet.** Write down any language syntax or algorithms that you always forget so that you can review them 15 minutes before your interview.
* **Practice on the platform that you'll be using.** Ask your recruiter or company contact!
