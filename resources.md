# Data Science Presentation

Choose an article or a talk from a conference that is related to a data science or data engineering topic. 

**Choose articles and talks that connect a data science method to a problem.** The goal of this assignment is to learn more about how data science and data analytics is applied in industry. Articles related to data science at a nonprofit or in government are also great!

In your 10-15 minute presentation, you must include: 

* What is the organization? 
  * What industry are they in? What do they do? 
  * What is the big problem they're trying to solve?
* Who wrote the article? What is their position within the organization?
* What is the specific problem they were trying to solve? How is it related to their business?
* What is the data science method or solution they applied to their problem? **Teach us something new!**
